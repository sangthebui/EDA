Only for Those Who Know.Center City : 400m to Bến Thành. 150m to Bánh Mì Huỳnh Hoa. 300m to Bùi Viện.Comfortable Apartment: 40m² with balcony, bathtub (hot water), Netflix, free laundry, basic kitchen, air-conFree Vietnamese iced coffee. Soft bed. Fast Wi-Fi.Not a party house—just charm, stillness, and soul.For those who travel to feel, not just see.Welcome. You found it.The space🌟 Not for Everyone. Only for Those Who Know.Tucked in the pulse of Saigon, exactly 400m from Bến Thành Market, 150m from Bánh Mì Huỳnh Hoa, and a lazy 300m stroll from Bùi Viện, this isn't just a place to crash. It's a curated experience for the rare kind — the vintage souls, the bathtub philosophers, the balcony coffee poets.🏠 Three Rooms, One Story⚠️ PLEASE NOTE: There are 3 rooms available. Both rooms are identical for 201 and 301. Room 401 has a smaller room but a huge outdoor balcony with an outdoor bathtub. Please see the last 14 photos for room 401. You would need to talk to us, as it's subject to availability. If you did not specify the room upon booking, a random room of the 3 rooms will be assigned to you. Why This Place Matters📍 Location That Speaks: You're not just in the center — you're in the right center. Five minutes on foot to Ben Thanh's organized chaos. Fifteen minutes to Pham Ngu Lao's backpacker symphony. Everything flows from this wide, safe alley where middle-class locals have called home since Saigon's independence. Senior citizens with stories, boutique shops with character, and the kind of neighborhood warmth that money can't manufacture.The Space That Understands: Your own 40m² sanctuary in a newly renovated building. A balcony where sunlight spills like gold and the city hums beneath you. A bathtub with real hot water — because some days demand disappears completely. A bed soft like regret after 3 AM texting. Netflix is ready for your drama, comedy, or existential documentary of choice.The Price That Makes Sense: While other Airbnbs in this location cost double, we believe luxury should be accessible to those who truly appreciate it.✨ What Awaits YouThe Essentials, Elevated:• ☕ Vietnamese iced coffee every morning — on the house. Sweet, strong, unapologetic like the city  • Free 50Mb/s WiFi (fast enough to stream, Zoom, or stalk your ex in 4K)  • Full kitchen with refrigerator, electric stove, and all cooking essentials  • Free laundry service (because clean shirts shouldn't cost your soul)  • Air conditioning for Saigon's passionate climate  The Experiences:• 🎬 Hollywood movies and Netflix Premium on our Dolby Vision projector  • Soak in our bathtub while watching films — romantic movie nights, redefined  • 🍷 Our curated wine list available at honest prices for evening wind-downs  • Explore local Vietnamese life scattered around the city center  The Details That Matter:• Accommodates up to 3 guests (2 on a bed, 1 on a quality floor mattress 1.2m x 1.8m). Please let us know in advance if you need the extra mattress so we can prepare it for you.• Complete toiletries: wipes, toothpaste, toothbrush, shampoo, shower gel  • Hair dryer and premium bath amenities  • Walking distance to Reunification Palace, Japanese Town, Vincom Plaza  This Is For You If...You notice how light hits old wood. You crave a good soak and quiet nights more than neon cocktails. You understand that ""center city"" means convenience and elegance, not chaos. You see beauty in worn tiles, value space over selfies, and travel not just to see, but to feel.This is not a party house. It doesn't do glow sticks or foam. But it does charm. It does slow mornings, silk robes, and handwritten notes. It does the authentic Saigon experience, where you'll never go hungry (local food available 24/7) and you'll always feel safe.So if you're someone who travels with intention, who appreciates the curated over the commercial — welcome. You found it.Like what you see? Book now and discover why those who know choose this place.Guest access- Guest access is available 24/7.  - Self-check-in is easy with a smart lock, allowing you to check in and out at any time without worry.  - There is an elevator for you- The property is located in a newly renovated private building, centrally situated in Ho Chi Minh City.
